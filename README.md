# GeneticAlgorithm_Implementation
Abstract:
This project explores the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in cryptanalysis, focusing on decrypting text encrypted with the Vigenere Cipher. The GA, inspired by natural selection processes, evolves a population of candidate decryption keys over multiple generations to improve fitness and reach the optimal solution. The paper discusses the key components of the algorithm, including population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and termination conditions. Additionally, it delves into the problem statement, emphasizing the importance of decrypting encrypted communications from both learning and security perspectives.
